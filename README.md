The project is called "PyCPU Monitor" and it serves as a custom interface to analize the parameters of the CPU.
It provides informations about:
  - frequency
  - CPU usage
  - core usage
  - core loads
  - the model of the CPU used and if it has an integrated graphics card
  - user info
  - number of physical and logical cores
  - the time and date from last boot
To make sure that the progam functions download the zip (from code) and in a powershell install the requirements file: pip install -r "requirements.txt"
